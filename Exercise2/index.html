 <p>Lace up boots are all the rage right now in fashion and the media. You may have seen your friends, celebrities, or even models wearing different types of lace up boots. If you have a pair of your own but you aren’t sure how to wear them, try wearing them with skinny jeans or even a pair of leggings to find a style that works for you.</p >

        <li><strong>Add tall socks to your boots for a pop of color.</strong></li>
          <p>If your boots are black or brown and you’d like to throw in a pop of color on top of them, wear tall socks that will peak between your boots and pants. If you want to keep a classic look, opt for neutral and toned-down colors, like black, white, or beige.</p >
            <ul>
             <li>Some stores sell socks that are specifically made for boots. These are usually thicker and will be easier to pull out of the top of your shoes.</li>

        <li><strong>Tie your boots tightly for a comfortable walking shoe.</strong></li>
          <p>Lace up boots are used for fashion and function. If you want to take a hike in your boots or are planning a long walk, make sure that your boots are tied snugly and fit on your feet well. This will cause less strain on your feet over time.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep your shoelaces loose for a relaxed look. Some boots have shoelaces that can be tied loosely or not at all and still stay on your feet. If you want to look relaxed and fashionable, keep your shoelaces loose and your boots slightly floppy when you wear them.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

        <li><strong>Look out for diarrhea.</strong></li>
          <p>Some cats become so distressed that it upsets their stomachs and they develop diarrhea. Regardless of the causes (stress or an infection), get your cat checked by a veterinarian, because medication may be needed to settle the upset stomach.</p>

       <li><strong>>Add tall socks to your boots for a pop of color. </strong></li>
         <p>Jeans that are loose fitting imply a more laid-back style. Pair your lace up boots with a relaxed or loose fitting pair of jeans that you can cuff at the bottom to emphasize your shoe.</p>

        <img src="images/5.jpg">

      <li>
        <p>Pair your boots with skinny jeans for a chic, stream-lined look. If you want to look put-together and stylish, skinny jeans are the way to go. Pair your boots with a dark-wash skinny jean that will compliment the rest of your outfit.</p></li>

      <li>
        <p>Dress up your boots with a midi skirt and tights. If you are going to an event or just feel like adding some pizzazz to your outfit, you can pair your lace up boots with a midi skirt and tights for a more polished, dressed-up outfit. Try wearing a floral dress with a black or brown pair of boots, or add a pop of color to a neutral dress with boots that have a bright color</p></li>
